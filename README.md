A Clarity smart contract providing a decentralized system for registering, managing, and sharing botanical specimens.  
Designed to facilitate scientific collaboration with secure, role-based access controls and efficient data retrieval mechanisms.

## Features

- üìö **Specimen Registration**: Register new botanical specimens with detailed metadata (title, size, description, classification labels).
- üîç **Specimen Retrieval**: Retrieve basic, minimal, or full specimen information optimized for different query needs.
- üîí **Access Control**: Grant and restrict examination rights on specimens to authorized researchers.
- ‚úèÔ∏è **Record Updates**: Update existing specimen records securely.
- üóëÔ∏è **Specimen Withdrawal**: Remove specimens from the catalog when necessary.
- ‚ö° **Efficient Validation**: Validate specimen parameters for integrity and format correctness.

## Smart Contract Structure

- **Constants**: System administrator definition, structured error codes.
- **Data Variables**: Global specimen counter.
- **Maps**:
  - `botanical-specimens`: Storage for all specimen records.
  - `specimen-access-rights`: Manages researcher access permissions.
- **Core Public Functions**:
  - `register-specimen`
  - `catalog-new-specimen`
  - `update-specimen-record`
  - `withdraw-specimen`
  - `display-specimen-information`
  - `retrieve-specimen-basic`
  - `prepare-specimen-display`
  - `retrieve-specimen-minimal`
  - `retrieve-specimen-description`
  - `verify-specimen-parameters`
- **Private Functions**: Validation and permission checks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Clarinet](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet/get-started) for local development and testing.
- Familiarity with [Clarity Language](https://docs.stacks.co/docs/clarity/clarity-overview).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/botanical-specimen-catalog.git
   cd botanical-specimen-catalog
   ```

2. Install Clarinet if you haven't:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://get.clarinet.dev | bash
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   clarinet test
   ```

## Usage

Deploy the smart contract onto a Stacks blockchain (testnet or mainnet) using Clarinet or directly through the Stacks Explorer interface.  
Interact with the contract via provided public functions to manage specimens securely and collaboratively.

## Contract Design Philosophy

- **Transparency**: Ensure that specimen records are tamper-evident and traceable.
- **Efficiency**: Minimize blockchain resource consumption during record retrieval.
- **Flexibility**: Support both detailed and minimalistic data access needs.
- **Security**: Apply strict access controls and validation checks to preserve data integrity.
